This project is a Python script that automates the organization of files on your desktop. The script monitors the Desktop folder and automatically moves newly added files into designated folders based on their file type. For example, images are moved to the Pictures folder, documents to the Documents folder, and so on. The script is designed to run continuously in the background, keeping your desktop tidy without manual sorting.

The script detects new files, checks their extensions, and moves them to pre-defined folders. It supports common file types such as images, documents, videos, and executables, but can be easily modified to handle other types. One of the main features is that it waits until files are fully downloaded or transferred to avoid moving incomplete or temporary files.

To use the script, first clone the repository and make sure you have Python installed on your system. No external libraries are required as the script uses only built-in Python modules. You can customize the folder paths and file types directly in the script to fit your needs.

Once the script is set up, it will automatically monitor your Desktop and organize files as they appear. You can modify the paths for the destination folders or add more file types to the script as needed. Itâ€™s a simple yet powerful tool for maintaining an organized workspace.
